   - Or serve it using a local server (recommended):
     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
     npx http-server
     
     # Using PHP
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Access the application**

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

### Production Security Recommendations
For production use, consider implementing:
- Server-side authentication with JWT tokens
- Proper password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2)
- HTTPS/SSL encryption
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Database storage instead of localStorage
- Server-side file validation and storage
- User session management
- CSRF protection

## Browser Compatibility

- **Features Required**:
  - ES6+ JavaScript support
  - Web Audio API (for recording)
  - FileReader API (for image uploads)
  - LocalStorage API
  - Service Worker API (optional, for offline functionality)

## Limitations

- Single-user application (no real-time multi-user chat)
- Client-side only (no server backend)
- Data stored locally (not synchronized across devices)
- Basic security implementation (suitable for demo/local use)

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time multi-user chat with WebSocket
- Server-side backend with proper authentication
