# Quick Chat Developer Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive information for developers working on the Quick Chat application. It covers the application architecture, key components, development workflow, and best practices.

## JavaScript Architecture

Quick Chat uses a modern, modular JavaScript architecture. Each module is responsible for a specific feature or functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

### Module Structure

The JavaScript codebase is organized into the following directory structure:

```
assets/js/
├── core/            # Core application modules
├── features/        # Feature-specific modules
├── ui/              # UI-related modules
├── utils/           # Utility functions
└── module-loader.js # Module loading system
```

### Core Modules

Core modules provide fundamental application functionality:

- `core/app.js` - Main application initialization
- `core/config.js` - Application configuration
- `core/error-handler.js` - Error handling and reporting
- `core/performance-monitor.js` - Performance monitoring
- `core/pwa-manager.js` - Progressive Web App features
- `core/security.js` - Security utilities
- `core/state.js` - Application state management
- `core/theme-manager.js` - Theme management
- `core/websocket-manager.js` - WebSocket connection handling

### Feature Modules

Feature modules implement specific application features:

- `features/admin/*` - Admin configuration and management
- `features/chat/*` - Chat-related functionality
- `features/profile/*` - User profile management
- `features/webrtc/*` - Video/audio call functionality

### UI Modules

UI modules handle user interface components:

- `ui/accessibility.js` - Accessibility features
- `ui/upload-progress.js` - Upload progress visualization
- `ui/virtual-scroll.js` - Virtual scrolling for chat messages

### Utility Modules

Utility modules provide helper functions:

- `utils/date-formatter.js` - Date formatting utilities
- `utils/file-helpers.js` - File handling utilities
- `utils/string-helpers.js` - String manipulation utilities

### Module Loading System

The application uses a custom module loader (`module-loader.js`) that provides:

- Dynamic module loading
- Dependency management
- Compatibility with both modern and legacy browsers
- Error handling for module loading failures

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your local environment by copying `config/config.sample.php` to `config/config.php`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create optimized JavaScript bundles in the `assets/js/dist` directory.

### Code Style and Standards

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Document all modules, classes, and functions using JSDoc comments
- Write unit tests for all new functionality

## Adding New Features

When adding new features to Quick Chat, follow these guidelines:

1. **Plan your feature:**
   - Determine which existing modules your feature will interact with
   - Design the API for your feature module
   - Consider any performance implications

2. **Create module files:**
   - Place your module in the appropriate directory (`core/`, `features/`, `ui/`, or `utils/`)
   - Use the naming convention `feature-name.js` (kebab-case)

3. **Implement the feature:**
   - Write clear, maintainable code
   - Document your code with JSDoc comments
   - Add appropriate error handling

4. **Test your feature:**
   - Write unit tests for your module
   - Test integration with other modules
   - Test across different browsers

5. **Document your feature:**
   - Update API documentation
   - Add examples of how to use your feature
   - Document any configuration options

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize DOM manipulation
- Optimize resource loading with code splitting
- Use virtual scrolling for long lists of messages
- Cache expensive computations and API results
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks

## Security Best Practices

- Always sanitize user input
- Use HTTPS for all communication
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regularly update dependencies
