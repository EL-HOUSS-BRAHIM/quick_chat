# Migration Plan for Quick Chat Application Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Quick Chat application from its current architecture to the new modern architecture. The migration will be done in phases to minimize disruption to the existing application.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (June - July 2025)

### Completed Tasks
- Set up front controller pattern with `index.php` as the single entry point
- Create modern routing system using FastRoute
- Move page controllers from root directory to `/app/controllers/`
- Update `.htaccess` to route all requests through the front controller
- Implement proper PSR-4 autoloading with Composer
- Move API endpoints to `/api/v1/` for proper versioning
- Create consistent API response format
- Implement security enhancements (CSP, CSRF, rate limiting)

### Remaining Tasks for Phase 1
- Set up migration path for database schema
- Create service classes for common functionality
- Implement proper input validation for all endpoints
- Complete security audit of all endpoints
- Add comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Phase 2: Controller Migration (July 2025)

### Tasks
- Migrate each page controller one by one to the new architecture
- Create view templates for each page
- Update all forms to use CSRF protection
- Implement proper validation for all form submissions
- Test each migrated controller thoroughly

## Phase 3: Model Migration (August 2025)

### Tasks
- Create model classes for all database tables
- Implement proper validation in models
- Add relationships between models
- Update controllers to use model classes
- Test all model functionality

## Phase 4: Service Layer (August - September 2025)

### Tasks
- Create service classes for business logic
- Move business logic from controllers to services
- Implement dependency injection
- Create unit tests for services
- Refactor controllers to use services

## Phase 5: API Migration (September 2025)

### Tasks
- Complete migration of all API endpoints to new structure
- Add authentication middleware for API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Test API endpoints thoroughly

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Finalization (October 2025)

### Tasks
- Remove all deprecated code
- Update all documentation
- Fix any remaining issues
- Optimize performance
- Finalize testing

## Migration Strategy

### For each file migration:

1. **Analysis**: Understand the current functionality
2. **Design**: Plan the new structure
3. **Implementation**: Create new classes and methods
4. **Testing**: Test the new implementation
5. **Switchover**: Update routes to use new implementation
6. **Verification**: Verify everything works as expected
7. **Cleanup**: Remove old implementation

### Database Considerations:

- No schema changes should be made during migration
- Database access should be abstracted through models
- Any schema changes should be done after the migration

### Testing Strategy:

- Create unit tests for new classes
- Create integration tests for controllers
- Test each migrated feature thoroughly
- Run automated tests on CI/CD pipeline

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues during migration:

1. Identify the issue
2. Determine if it can be fixed quickly
3. If not, roll back to the previous implementation
4. Fix the issue in development
5. Try the migration again

## Communication Plan

- Update the team weekly on migration progress
- Document all changes in the codebase
- Notify users of any potential disruptions
- Provide training for developers on the new architecture
