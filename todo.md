## Files to Remove (After Migration)

Once you've migrated the functionality and tested that everything works, you can remove these files:

1. **admin.js** (if functionality is fully covered in features/admin/index.js)
2. **index.js** (if functionality is fully covered in main.js)
3. **integration.js** (if functionality is fully covered in core modules)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Missing Directories (June 19-20, 2025) ✅
- ✅ Create `/assets/js/ui` directory if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Ensure all feature subdirectories are properly set up

### Phase 2: Migrate Core Functionality (June 20-22, 2025) ✅
- ✅ Start with core functionality like security.js and pwa-manager.js
  - ✅ security.js → core/security.js
  - ✅ pwa-manager.js → core/pwa-manager.js
- ✅ Update imports in main.js and other relevant files
- ✅ Test core functionality after migration

### Phase 3: Migrate Feature Functionality (June 22-26, 2025) ✅
- ✅ Migrate chat-related files:
  - ✅ private-chat.js → features/chat/private-chat.js
  - ✅ realtime-features.js → features/chat/realtime.js
  - ✅ message-search.js → features/chat/search.js
  - ✅ user-mentions.js → features/chat/mentions.js
  - ✅ message-reactions.js → features/chat/reactions.js

- ✅ Migrate admin-related files:
  - ✅ admin-config.js → features/admin/config-manager.js

- ✅ Migrate profile-related files:
  - ✅ user-preferences.js → features/profile/preferences.js

- ✅ Migrate webrtc-related files:
  - ✅ call-interface.js → features/webrtc/ui.js

- ✅ Test each feature after migration

### Phase 4: Migrate UI Components (June 26-28, 2025) ✅
- ✅ Create UI components:
  - ✅ accessibility.js → ui/accessibility.js
  - ✅ file-upload-progress.js → ui/upload-progress.js
  - ✅ virtual-scroll-messaging.js → ui/virtual-scroll.js

- ✅ Update imports in relevant files
- ✅ Test UI components after migration

### Phase 5: Testing (June 28-30, 2025)
- ⏳ Comprehensive testing of all migrated functionality
- ⏳ Ensure backward compatibility with older code
- ⏳ Test in multiple browsers
- ⏳ Test with different user accounts and scenarios

### Phase 6: Cleanup (July 1-2, 2025)
- ⏳ Remove obsolete files after thorough testing:
  - admin.js
  - index.js
  - integration.js
  - And other files confirmed to be fully migrated

- ⏳ Update documentation to reflect the new structure
- ✅ Verify that no references to old files remain in HTML templates

## Detailed File-by-File Migration Checklist

For each file to be migrated, follow these steps:

- [x] Create the target file in the new structure if it doesn't exist
- [x] Compare functionality with any existing files in the new structure
- [x] Merge functionality if needed, prioritizing the new structure's patterns
- [x] Update imports in relevant files
- [x] Test the functionality
- [x] Update backward compatibility layer if needed
- [ ] Remove the original file only after successful testing

## Required Updates to HTML Files

After migrating JavaScript files, ensure the following HTML files are updated to reference the new structure:

- [x] index.php
- [x] chat.php
- [x] private-chat.php
- [x] group-chat.php
- [x] dashboard.php
- [x] profile.php
- [x] admin.php

## Additional Considerations

1. **Bundle Size**: After migration, analyze the bundle size to ensure it hasn't grown unnecessarily large.

2. **Performance Monitoring**: Use the existing PerformanceMonitor class to track performance before and after migration.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the migrated code works across all supported browsers.

4. **Error Tracking**: Monitor error logs closely during and after migration to catch any issues.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure the application remains functional even if some JavaScript features fail to load.

6. **Documentation**: Update JSDoc comments in all new files to maintain code documentation standards.
