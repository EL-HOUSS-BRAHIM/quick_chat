## Conclusion

The architectural restructuring and consolidation work has been completed. The focus now should be on:

1. ✅ Building a comprehensive testing framework (Started)
2. ✅ Optimizing performance for production (Started)
3. ✅ Enhancing the PWA capabilities (Started)
4. ✅ Improving documentation for developers (Started)

As of June 18, 2025, significant progress has been made:
- Testing framework set up with Jest and Cypress
- WebRTC connection pooling implemented
- Code splitting and bundle optimization improved
- Service worker enhanced with Workbox
- PWA offline functionality improved
- Documentation system set up with JSDoc

The next priority should be completing the remaining integration tests, enhancing the push notification system, and creating the architecture diagrams and developer onboarding guide.

## Files Status Update

All files that needed to be consolidated or deleted have been properly processed. The codebase has been successfully reorganized with a modular structure, with proper organization in the core and features directories.
