# Quick Chat Development Roadmap (Updated June 20, 2025)

## Project Status
The Quick Chat application has achieved significant milestones in its modular JavaScript architecture transformation. The new ES6 module system is fully operational with 95% of core functionality migrated to the new architecture. All major chat features including real-time messaging, WebRTC calling, file uploads, user management, and admin tools are now implemented using the modern module structure. The legacy code has been successfully preserved in backup directories while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Recent Achievements (June 2025)
// ...existing code...
// All legacy JavaScript files have been removed from the main codebase and backed up to `backups/js_deprecated_2025-06-19_18-59-46/` as of June 19, 2025. See DEPRECATION_TIMELINE.md for details.
