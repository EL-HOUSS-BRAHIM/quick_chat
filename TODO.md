# Quick Chat Development Roadmap (Updated June 25, 2025)

## Project Status
The Quick Chat application has made significant progress in both frontend and backend architecture improvements. We've successfully implemented the module loader, build system with Webpack, and CSS preprocessing with SASS. The core architectural overhaul of our PHP codebase as part of Phase 1 is now approximately 85% complete, with the new MVC structure, routing system, and middleware implementations in place. We're currently focusing on WebRTC improvements and accessibility enhancements as we prepare for the next major release.
