# Quick Chat Development Roadmap (Updated June 19, 2025)

## Project Status
The Quick Chat application has made significant progress in frontend architecture improvements. We've successfully implemented the module loader, build system with Webpack, and CSS preprocessing with SASS. We have now started the core architectural overhaul of our PHP codebase as part of Phase 1.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Application Architecture Overhaul
- [x] Implement front controller pattern with `index.php` as the single entry point
- [x] Create a modern routing system using FastRoute or a similar library

- [x] Update `.htaccess` to route all requests through the front controller
- [x] Implement proper PSR-4 autoloading with Composer

### 2. API Standardization and Versioning
- [x] Move all API endpoints to `/api/v1/` for proper versioning
- [x] Create consistent response format (status, data, errors)
- [x] Implement proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- [x] Standardize authentication headers and token handling

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Complete security audit of all endpoints
- [x] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [x] Enhance CSRF protection implementation
- [x] Add API rate limiting for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper input validation with filtering
- [x] Add brute force protection for authentication endpoints

- [ ] Implement web socket support for real-time updates

### 8. User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Create dark/light theme with better accessibility
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Add user presence indicators (active, away, do not disturb)
- [ ] Create better mobile experience for file uploads
- [ ] Implement message reactions with emoji picker improvements
- [ ] Add voice messages with transcription

### 9. Group Chat Enhancements
- [ ] Implement role-based permissions in group chats
- [ ] Add moderation features (mute, ban, report)

- [ ] Implement shared task lists for groups
- [ ] Add event scheduling within group chats
- [ ] Create group chat discovery feature

## Low Priority Tasks

### 10. Administrative Features
- [ ] Create comprehensive admin dashboard
- [ ] Add usage statistics and reporting
- [ ] Implement user management for administrators
