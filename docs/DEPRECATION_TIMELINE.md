# Compatibility Layer Deprecation Timeline

## Overview

This document outlines the timeline for removing the compatibility layers from the codebase. These compatibility layers were implemented to ensure a smooth transition from the old JavaScript architecture to the new modular architecture. As all modules have been successfully migrated, we can now begin the process of gradually removing these compatibility layers.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Deprecation Warning (July 2025)

- **Start Date:** July 1, 2025
- **End Date:** July 31, 2025
- **Actions:**
  - Add `@deprecated` JSDoc tags to all compatibility layer files
  - Update build process to emit console warnings when deprecated files are imported
  - Add deprecation notices in developer documentation
  - Create internal documentation with migration guides for each compatibility layer

### Phase 2: Internal Migration (August 2025)

- **Start Date:** August 1, 2025
- **End Date:** August 31, 2025
- **Actions:**
  - Update all internal imports to use new module paths
  - Prioritize updating the least-used modules first:
    1. `accessibility.js` → `ui/accessibility.js`
    2. `emoji.js` → `features/chat/emoji-picker.js`
    3. `file-upload-progress.js` → `ui/upload-progress.js`
    4. `user-mentions.js` → `features/chat/mentions.js`
    5. `virtual-scroll-messaging.js` → `ui/virtual-scroll.js`
  - Run comprehensive tests after each update

### Phase 3: Major System Updates (September 2025)

- **Start Date:** September 1, 2025
- **End Date:** September 30, 2025
- **Actions:**
  - Update moderately-used modules:
    1. `message-reactions.js` → `features/chat/reactions.js`
    2. `message-search.js` → `features/chat/search.js`
    3. `user-preferences.js` → `features/profile/preferences.js`
    4. `file-management.js` → `features/chat/file-uploader.js`
    5. `security.js` → `core/security.js`
  - Verify that all module integrations are working correctly
  - Begin error monitoring for any potential issues

### Phase 4: Core System Migration (October 2025)

- **Start Date:** October 1, 2025
- **End Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Actions:**
  - Update frequently-used modules:
    1. `group-chat.js` → `features/chat/group-info.js`
    2. `private-chat.js` → `features/chat/private-chat.js`
    3. `realtime-features.js` → `features/chat/realtime.js`
    4. `pwa-manager.js` → `core/pwa-manager.js`
  - Run full test suite after each update
  - Implement additional monitoring for high-traffic features

### Phase 5: Final Compatibility Removal (November 2025)

- **Start Date:** November 1, 2025
- **End Date:** November 30, 2025
- **Actions:**
  - Remove all compatibility layer files
  - Update any remaining external references
  - Clean up legacy imports from HTML templates
  - Run final comprehensive test suite
  - Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Monitoring and Fallback Plan

Throughout this process, we will maintain:

1. **Real-time Error Monitoring:** Using our error reporting system to quickly identify and address any issues
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Ensuring that the changes do not negatively impact application performance
3. **Fallback Mechanism:** Ability to quickly revert changes if critical issues are discovered

## Communication Plan

- Weekly progress updates to the development team
- Monthly status reports to stakeholders
- Documentation of all changes in the system changelog
- User-facing update notices for any maintenance periods
